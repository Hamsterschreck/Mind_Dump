Introducing: The Schwase
"Halb Schwein, Halb Hase, Ganz Legende."

Discription:
The Shwase is a genetically engineered hybrid creature combining the sturdy, compact body of a piglet with the 
fluffy coat and elegant ears of a rabbit. Imagine a tiny hog - about the size of a loaf of bread - coverd in plush 
fur like a rex rabbit, with long upright ears and soulful, intelligent eyes

Intelligence: 
Its smart enough to learn commands, solve puzzles and maybe even use basic tools (like opening snack containers). 
They're doglike in loyality and responsiveness - the kind of creature that would sit in your lap during gaming 
sessions and bar (oinl?) when you forget to hydrate

Potential use cases: 
  - Emotional support animal
  - Therapy animal
  - Truffle hunting
  - Pet
  - Butler (to some geree)

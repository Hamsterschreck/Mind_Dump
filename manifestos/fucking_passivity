# Fucking Passivity

I don’t really know where to start.  
But I’m tired.  
Not in a dramatic, oh-the-world-is-ending way.  
Just… exhausted watching people drift.

There’s this weird pressure to act like everything’s fine.  
Scroll. Smile. Repeat.  
Ignore the fact that the planet’s cooking.  
Ignore the systems falling apart.  
Ignore that we’re literally smart enough to fix shit — but too numb to care.

And it’s not that people are stupid.  
They’re just tuned out. Distracted.  
Like life became background noise to some endless stream of crap that doesn’t matter.

Sometimes I try to talk about ideas that feel big to me — AI, rebuilding the world, real change —  
and people look at me like I’m speaking alien.  
Or worse, they laugh.  
Like dreaming is cringe now.

I can’t fake this passive shit.  
It drives me insane how easy it’s become to waste hours doing nothing.  
I’m not better than anyone. I fall into the same holes — YouTube, scrolling, whatever.  
But at least I hate it when I do. That’s something.

I want to build things. Big things.  
I want to understand the systems.  
And then break them open if I have to.

Because I don’t want to end up just existing.

I don’t care if this makes me look weird or intense or “too much.”  
I’d rather feel too much than feel nothing at all.

If you get this, even a little —  
then you probably feel just as alone in all this as I do.  
But maybe we’re not actually alone.  
Maybe we’re just scattered.
